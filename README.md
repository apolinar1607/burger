  ## Description 
  
  This application is a Burger App that utilize Node.js, MySQL, Express, and Handlebars. This app follows MVC design pattern; it uses Node MySQL to query and route data to app, Handlebars to generate the HTML. The application is deployed in Heroku so I used JawsDB MySQL add-ons to integrate the database in Heroku.

  As part of the requirement for this assignment, I have revised my 'Updated Portfolio' app that now includes link to this application as well as the Github repo.
